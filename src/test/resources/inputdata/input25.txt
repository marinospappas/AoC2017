Begin in state A.
Perform a diagnostic checksum after 6 steps.

In state A:
  If the current value is 0:
    - Write the value 1.
    - Move one slot to the right.
    - Continue with state B.
  If the current value is 1:
    - Write the value 0.
    - Move one slot to the left.
    - Continue with state B.

In state B:
  If the current value is 0:
    - Write the value 1.
    - Move one slot to the left.
    - Continue with state A.
  If the current value is 1:
    - Write the value 1.
    - Move one slot to the right.
    - Continue with state A.


    --- example solution
    ... 0  0  0 [0] 0  0 ... (before any steps; about to run state A)
    ... 0  0  0  1 [0] 0 ... (after 1 step;     about to run state B)
    ... 0  0  0 [1] 1  0 ... (after 2 steps;    about to run state A)
    ... 0  0 [0] 0  1  0 ... (after 3 steps;    about to run state B)
    ... 0 [0] 1  0  1  0 ... (after 4 steps;    about to run state A)
    ... 0  1 [1] 0  1  0 ... (after 5 steps;    about to run state B)
    ... 0  1  1 [0] 1  0 ... (after 6 steps;    about to run state A)
